# American Museum of Natural History - Hack the Deep Code of Conduct

## 0. Following the Rules

By participating in Hack the Deep, you agree to comply with this Code of Conduct, the Museum's policy on Acceptable Use of Computing Resources (which you may read upon connecting to the Museum wireless network), Museum policies and procedures regarding the safety and security of its visitors, guests, facilities and collections, and the direction of Museum staff and volunteers while you are at the event. Participants who do not comply with any of the above may be asked to leave the event and may be prohibited from participating in similar future events at the Museum.

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of Hack The Deep is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Hack The Deep to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Source Citizenship and Participants' Creations

The mission of Hack the Deep is to showcase the role computer science plays in scientific research and to develop open-source tools and apps for the advancement of science. The projects created by Hack the Deep participants will use publicly-available Museum databases and other open-source resources. Participants agree to publish all works created at Hack the Deep in publicly-available databases or websites and to permit others to access and use these works on a royalty-free, open source, non-commercial basis. If you wish to make commercially-viable solutions, please consider attending another event. Participants additionally agree not to disrupt other participants' work at Hack the Deep, or use content being created by other participants without express consent.

You agree that any original work you create is freely available without restriction or is licensed as open source as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd). If you do not specify a specific OSI compliant license in your repository, your works will be considered released under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Filming and Photography

Hack the Deep may be filmed or photographed by the Museum for its non-profit educational and fundraising purposes including for promoting Museum events and Public Programs, in any form of media, anywhere. In addition, invited members of the press may be present at the event and may also film or photograph the event and the participants. By participating in Hack the Deep, you agree to be filmed or photographed for these purposes, as also indicated on the accompanying release forms.

## 4. No Promotion

Hack the Deep is a creative and educational event, and is not a forum for business development or promotion. Participants may not engage in promotion of themselves or their businesses, including networking unrelated to Hack the Deep challenges, distributing printed materials or branded merchandise of any kind without the knowledge or consent of organizers, pitching a business or idea that is unrelated to Hack the Deep challenges, or any form of transactional or sales activity, whether or not money is involved.

## 5. No Alcohol, Etc

No alcohol or other controlled or illegal substances of any kind will be allowed at Hack the Deep (excluding alcohol served as part of the event or medications taken at the direction of a physician). Possession of any such substances will result in immediate expulsion from Hack the Deep, and any participant who appears to be intoxicated or under the influence of any such substance will be asked to leave the event immediately for the health and safety of all participants.

## 6. Only participants who are 18+ will spend the night at the museum

Applications for participants under 18 are limited to the BridgeUP: STEM Brown Scholars and invited high school student participants who will be supervised and chaperoned by their teachers.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including all participants and organizers and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately and to not repeat their behavior.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning and notifying security to take additional measures, at the Museum's sole discretion.

## 10. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an event organizer as soon as possible in person, via Slack, or in email at bridgeuphackathon@amnh.org and organizers will promptly address it.

Additionally, organizers are available to help community members engage with security or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. Organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## 11. Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the directors of AMNH BridgeUP: STEM with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## 12. Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to the community and the event.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
